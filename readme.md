# Quadratic equations:

A universal program used for solving quadratic equations.

Using a console input print 3 numbers (coefficients a, b, c of the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0) to get ur roots.

Using console input u can input numbers infinitely, unless u type non-digit.

Different functions are used to examine various coefficients of the equation (linear and non-linear).

A program has unit-tests for debug, using commenting and file input. U can write ur test in the file with number of roots and roots themselves. GOOD - test was passed, BAD - wasnt.

ALL Variables and pointers are initialized.

Also, a check function is determined to compare non-integral numbers.
