# quadratic_equations

A universal programm used for solving quadratic equations. 
Usimg a console input print 3 numbers (coefficients a, b, c of the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0) to get ur roots.
Using console input u can input numbers infinitly, unless u type non-digit.
Different functions are used to examine various coefficients of the equation (linear and non-linear). 
A programm has unit-tests for debug, using coomenting and file input. 
ALL Variables and pointers are initialized. 
Also, a check function is determined to compare non-integral numbers.
